# School District Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this challenge was to explore a dataset involving school performance, budget, and type of institution (among other things.)


## Summary
After cleaning the data, we looked at basic summary statistics. The table can be seen below.

One thing to note was that the standard deviation for school budgets was pretty big, at $53,938. It would be interesting to run a regression analysis on this and further explore the extent to which the type of school (or the scores made in schools) influences the budget they have.

The table below  shows the gruoping of math scores by grade and schoo type.

One obvious thing to note is that charter schools generally had a better performance in math early on. While public schools were relatively consistent over time but under performing compared to charter schools in the first two years. Further examination of why that is would be an interesting avenue for further study, though I would theorize it has something to do with the specializations of charter schools, especially in the last two years.

Looking at the table above we see that, n average, public schools appear to have a substantially larger budget than charter schools, but there are a lot of other variables that could and should be examined here. Such as looking at the budgets for each public school and checking for outliers, something that should be looked into if this project were to be picked up in the future.
